# Run instructions: verify when applicable

When you add or change run instructions (e.g. in README, implementation summaries, or docs):

1. **Run the instructions** – Start required servers and processes (e.g. `npm run start`, `npm run dev`).
2. **Verify they work** – Confirm processes start successfully and no errors occur.
3. **Apply when applicable** – Do this for new backends, new dev workflows, or changes to startup commands.

Example: After adding a chat-api server, run `cd chat-api && npm run start` and `npm run dev` to verify both start.
