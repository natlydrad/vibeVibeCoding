# Git: commit and push after major work

After completing a **major change**, **new feature**, or **refactor**:

1. Stage changes: `git add .`
2. Commit with a short message: `git commit -m "Description of what changed"`
3. Push: `git push`

Do this at the end of the task so the remote repo stays in sync. Do not skip this step unless the user says otherwise.
