# Project rules

## Git workflow

- **Commit and push with every major change or feature add.**  
  After implementing a significant change, new feature, or refactor, run:
  - `git add .`
  - `git commit -m "Brief description of the change"`
  - `git push`

This keeps the remote repo in sync and preserves a clear history.
